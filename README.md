Eco-Friendly Travel Planner : [Green Wander]


Problem Statement :
  In an era of increasing environmental awareness and sustainability, there is a growing need for travellers to make eco-conscious choices when planning their journeys. However, the information and tools available for travellers to make sustainable decisions are often scattered and not easily accessible.

Solution :
  Develop a travel planning application that not only helps users manage their expenses but also promotes eco-friendly travel options. This could include calculating the carbon footprint of a trip and suggesting sustainable travel alternatives.

Outcome :
  The expected outcome of an Eco-Friendly Travel Planner is to reduce travellers' carbon footprints, promote sustainable travel choices, and foster a more eco-conscious and responsible travel industry.
